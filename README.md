# Billable
Karsten Collins, Amber Courtight, and Mercedes Ponce's senior capstone app

This is a capstone project that is written in python using the Django framework. Billable is designed to be a one stop location that users can store and view anything related
to their finances. There is the ability to add individual transactions, bank account info, income info, and contact information for companies that the user interacts
with. The user can filter down any information that they have entered by any field that they desire. This goes for all different sections of the app. 

There is also a calendar that the user can use to help visualize important events, i.e rent payments, car payment, etc. These events are not limited to financial events, the
user can put anything they desire in the calendar.
